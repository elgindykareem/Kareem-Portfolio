## About

Hey, welcome to my portfolio where I showcase my recent projects in analytics. I'm finishing my degree in *Mathematical Statistics* at Stockholm's University, where I acquired skills in 
- Cleaning, visualizing and analyzing data, 
- Applying and understanding statistical methods: **OLS, Logistic Regression, kMeans, kNN, XGBoost, time forecasting, Fama-French Asset modeling.**
- Rigorous understanding of multivariable calculus and *real analysis*
- Communicating results clearly

I have a special interest in **time series analysis** and **classification** for data from the media industry. **Data engineering** by managing databases and building data pipelines is also something I am open to.

### Working with me

I keep my analysis thorough and communicable, always regarding my team and the stakeholder first. Understanding **who's reading the results** greatly speeds up workflow and analyzing what's important, building products that matter is what I'm here for. I value efficient communication of data, using **visual tools and dashboards**, we can easily tell stakeholders what they need to know. **UI and UX design** is something I've studied in the past and enjoy incorporating into data science. 

# Projects

## [Project 1: Spotify Charts Analysis](https://github.com/elgindykareem/spotifychartsanalysis)
(The full project is not yet fully integrated into the dashboard, but it will be working before Dec 31st 2021)

This project is a dashboard for data analysis, time series modeling and classification of Spotify Top 200 & Viral 50 Charts. This is a business application of my **Thesis in Mathematical Statistics:** *Financial Modeling of Music Streaming Data.* Where I investigate if we can borrow statistical and mathematical methods from finance and apply it to other markets where the characteristics may be similar. * Think of daily streams of the no.1 track on Spotify's Top 200 as the daily stock price of a company.*

Tools:
- Data import, cleaning and wrangling
- Data warehousing
- Data visualization
- Data modeling (time series, classification)
- Web app development

## [Project 2: Avocado Supply Prices 2015 - 2018](https://github.com/elgindykareem/Avocado-Prices)
*(This notebook isn't uploaded fully to repo yet)*
Visualizing and modeling ARIMA time series on avocado supply prices in the US based on region from 2015 to 2018. With variables such as quantity, total sales, type of avocado and bag size of order.

Tools:
- Data import, cleaning and wrangling
- Data visualization
- Data modeling (time series, ARIMA, regression models)
