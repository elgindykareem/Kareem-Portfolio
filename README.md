## About

Hey, welcome to my portfolio where I showcase my recent projects in data science. I'm finishing my degree in *Mathematical Statistics* at Stockholm's University, where I acquired skills in 
- Cleaning, visualizing and analyzing data, 
- Applying and understanding statistical methods: *OLS, Logistic Regression, kMeans, kNN, XGBoost, time forecasting, Fama-French Asset modeling.*
- Rigorous understanding of multivariable calculus and *real analysis*
- Communicating results clearly

I have a special interest in *time series analysis* and *classification* for data from the media industry. 

As a data scientist, I keep my analysis thorough and communicable, always regarding the stakeholder first. Understanding **who's reading the results** greatly speeds up workflow and analyzing what's important. I value efficient communication of data, using visual tools and dashboards, we can easily tell stakeholders what they need to know. UI and UX design is something I've studied in the past and enjoy incorporating into data science. 

# [Project 1: Spotify Charts Analysis](https://github.com/elgindykareem/spotifychartsanalysis)

This project is a dashboard for data analysis, time series modeling and classification of Spotify Top 200 & Viral 50 Charts. This is a business application of my **Bachelor Thesis in Mathematical Statistics:** *Financial Modeling of Music Streaming Data.* Where I investigate if we can borrow statistical and mathematical methods from finance and apply it to other markets where the characteristics may be similar. * Think of daily streams of the no.1 track on Spotify's Top 200 as the daily stock price of a company.*
